Configuration Reference
=======================

All QuantumPDB parameters are set in a YAML configuration file passed to
the CLI with ``-c config.yaml``. Parameters are organized into three
sections corresponding to the three CLI commands.

Only include the parameters you need --- all parameters have sensible defaults.

RUN Parameters
--------------

These parameters control ``qp run`` (structure preparation, protonation, and
cluster extraction).

**Pipeline control:**

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 15 60

   * - Parameter
     - Default
     - Description
   * - ``input``
     - ``[]``
     - Path to input CSV, single PDB code, local PDB path, or list of PDB
       codes (e.g., ``[1OS7, 1FYZ]``).
   * - ``output_dir``
     - ``''``
     - Directory where all output files are saved.
   * - ``modeller``
     - ``false``
     - Enable Modeller to rebuild missing atoms, residues, and loops.
   * - ``protoss``
     - ``false``
     - Enable Protoss to assign protonation states via the web server.
   * - ``coordination``
     - ``false``
     - Enable QM cluster model generation.
   * - ``skip``
     - ``'all'``
     - Skip existing results. ``'modeller'`` skips only Modeller,
       ``'protoss'`` skips only Protoss, ``'all'`` skips both if their
       output files already exist. To force re-processing, delete the
       output files.
   * - ``optimize_select_residues``
     - ``1``
     - Modeller refinement level: ``0`` = none, ``1`` = missing residues
       only, ``2`` = all residues.
   * - ``max_clash_refinement_iter``
     - ``5``
     - Maximum iterations of the Modeller--Protoss feedback loop for
       resolving steric clashes. Under ProteinsPlus API v2 this loop is
       currently inactive because the Protoss clash log is no longer
       available; the parameter is retained for compatibility.
   * - ``convert_to_nhie_oxo``
     - ``false``
     - Enable the specialized AKG → succinate / oxo NHIE conversion after
       Protoss. Requires ``modeller`` and ``protoss``. Legacy alias
       ``convert_to_oxo`` is also accepted. See :doc:`special_workflows`.

**Cluster model parameters:**

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 15 60

   * - Parameter
     - Default
     - Description
   * - ``center_residues``
     - ``[]``
     - Three-letter residue code(s) for the cluster center. Use YAML list
       syntax: ``[FE]``, ``[FE, FE2]``. In batch mode a YAML list is consumed
       **one entry per PDB**. For multiple centers inside one structure, use
       fuzzy CSV/YAML syntax, an explicit CSV ``center`` column, or
       ``merge_distance_cutoff``. See :doc:`input_formats`.
   * - ``additional_ligands``
     - ``[]``
     - List of three-letter residue codes to force into the first interaction
       sphere (e.g., ``[AKG, SIN]``). These residues are also protected from
       pruning.
   * - ``force_include_residues``
     - ``[]``
     - List of specific protein residues to force-include, even if they lie
       beyond the grown spheres, given as ``RESNAME_CHAINID`` keys (e.g.,
       ``[HIS_A123]``). Added residues are capped like any other extracted
       residue and protected from ``max_atom_count`` pruning. Can also be
       set per PDB via an ``force_include_residues`` CSV column, which takes
       priority over this YAML list when present. See :doc:`input_formats`.
   * - ``force_remove_residues``
     - ``[]``
     - List of specific protein residues to force-exclude, given as
       ``RESNAME_CHAINID`` keys (e.g., ``[HIS_A123]``), even if sphere
       growth, ``additional_ligands``, or ``force_include_residues`` would
       otherwise include them. On conflict with ``force_include_residues``,
       removal wins. Cannot remove the cluster's center (ignored with a
       warning). Shrink-only: does not backfill toward ``max_atom_count``.
       Can also be set per PDB via a ``force_remove_residues`` CSV column,
       which takes priority over this YAML list when present. See
       :doc:`input_formats`.
   * - ``number_of_spheres``
     - ``2``
     - Number of interaction spheres to construct. More spheres capture more
       of the protein environment at increased computational cost.
   * - ``radius_of_first_sphere``
     - ``4.0``
     - Distance cutoff in angstroms for the first (distance-based) sphere.
       The default of 4.0 Å works well for most systems. Increase for
       large ligands or weak interactions.
   * - ``include_ligands``
     - ``2``
     - Ligand inclusion level: ``0`` = first sphere only, ``1`` = non-water
       ligands, ``2`` = all ligands and waters, ``3`` = center residue(s),
       standard amino acids, and waters only (exclude non-standard ligands
       from outer spheres). Protoss RGP/R# attachment points are collected
       automatically when charges are computed and used for hydrogen capping.
   * - ``max_atom_count``
     - ``None``
     - Maximum number of atoms in the QM cluster. When set, the most distant
       residues are pruned until the count is below the threshold. Capping
       atoms are not counted toward this limit.
   * - ``merge_distance_cutoff``
     - ``0.0``
     - Distance in angstroms for merging nearby center residues into a single
       center. Set slightly larger than the metal--metal distance. Examples:
       4.0 for MMO diiron (~3.4 Å), 12.0 for PHM dicopper (~11 Å).
   * - ``capping_method``
     - ``1``
     - How to cap chain breaks: ``0`` = none, ``1`` = hydrogen caps,
       ``2`` = ACE/NME caps. Use hydrogen caps for single-point energy
       calculations and ACE/NME for geometry optimizations.
   * - ``smoothing_method``
     - ``2``
     - Voronoi regularization method mapped by the CLI as:
       ``0`` → ``box_plot``, ``1`` → ``dbscan`` (``eps=6``, ``min_samples=3``),
       ``2`` → ``dummy_atom`` (``mean_distance=3``, recommended),
       ``3`` → no smoothing. See :doc:`cluster_models`.

**Output control:**

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 15 60

   * - Parameter
     - Default
     - Description
   * - ``compute_charges``
     - ``true``
     - Compute per-residue charges from protonation states and ligand
       properties. If ``true`` (or if ``capping_method`` is non-zero), Protoss
       is forced on.
   * - ``count_residues``
     - ``true``
     - Count the number of residues in each interaction sphere and write
       ``count.csv``.
   * - ``write_xyz``
     - ``true``
     - Write XYZ coordinate files alongside PDB cluster files.
   * - ``write_hetero_pdb``
     - ``false``
     - When writing the combined cluster PDB, keep HETATM records. Default
       combined PDBs focus on the QM-relevant capped model.
   * - ``cluster_name_template``
     - ``None``
     - Optional format string for cluster directory / file names. Available
       fields include ``radius``, ``metal_id``, ``index``, and ``pdb``.
       Default (``None``) names clusters by ``metal_id``. When set, also
       writes ``cluster_name_map.csv``.


SUBMIT Parameters
-----------------

These parameters control ``qp submit`` (QM job creation and submission).

**QM calculation settings:**

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 15 60

   * - Parameter
     - Default
     - Description
   * - ``optimization``
     - ``false``
     - ``true`` for geometry optimization, ``false`` for single-point energy.
   * - ``method``
     - ``'wpbeh'``
     - DFT functional used as the job subdirectory name and in the TeraChem
       input. Examples: ``wpbeh``, ``b3lyp``, ``ub3lyp``, ``pbe0``.
   * - ``basis``
     - ``'lacvps_ecp'``
     - Basis set. Common choices: ``lacvps_ecp``, ``6-31g*``, ``def2-svp``.
   * - ``guess``
     - ``'generate'``
     - Initial wavefunction guess method.
   * - ``gpus``
     - ``1``
     - Number of GPUs for TeraChem calculations.
   * - ``memory``
     - ``'8G'``
     - Memory allocation per job.
   * - ``dielectric``
     - ``10``
     - Dielectric constant for implicit solvent (PCM). Use ``10`` for
       protein interior, ``78.4`` for aqueous solvent.
   * - ``use_implicit_solvent``
     - ``not charge_embedding``
     - Enable PCM implicit solvent (COSMO). Defaults to ``true`` when
       ``charge_embedding`` is ``false``, and ``false`` when
       ``charge_embedding`` is ``true``, preserving backward-compatible
       behavior. Set explicitly to ``true`` alongside
       ``charge_embedding: true`` to use both MM point charges and
       implicit solvent simultaneously.
   * - ``charge_embedding``
     - ``false``
     - Include MM point charges around the QM cluster. By default uses
       ff14SB partial charges (also TIP3P for water, standard charges for
       common ions). The charge source can be customized with
       ``charge_embedding_charges``.
   * - ``charge_embedding_cutoff``
     - ``20``
     - Distance cutoff in angstroms for MM point charges, measured from the
       QM cluster centroid. If any atom of a residue falls within this
       distance, all atoms of that residue are included to preserve
       integer per-residue charge contributions.
   * - ``charge_embedding_charges``
     - ``null``
     - Path to a JSON file with custom partial charges, keyed by residue
       name then atom name (e.g., ``{"ALA": {"N": -0.4157, ...}}``).
       When ``null``, uses the built-in AMBER ff14SB charges.
   * - ``scheduler``
     - ``'slurm'``
     - Job scheduler: ``'slurm'`` or ``'sge'``. Generated scripts include
       site-specific module / partition settings that may need editing for
       your cluster.
   * - ``pcm_radii_file``
     - ``'pcm_radii'``
     - Path to a custom PCM radii file (TeraChem-specific).

**Job management:**

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 15 60

   * - Parameter
     - Default
     - Description
   * - ``create_jobs``
     - ``false``
     - Generate TeraChem ``qmscript.in`` and scheduler scripts for each
       cluster. Requires CSV ``input`` with ``oxidation`` and
       ``multiplicity``.
   * - ``submit_jobs``
     - ``false``
     - Submit generated jobs to the scheduler.
   * - ``job_count``
     - ``80``
     - Maximum number of concurrent jobs on the scheduler.

.. note::

   ``qp submit`` expects ``input`` to be a path to an existing CSV file. PDB
   IDs and YAML lists accepted by ``qp run`` are not valid submit inputs.


ANALYZE Parameters
------------------

These parameters control ``qp analyze`` (job monitoring and post-processing).

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 15 60

   * - Parameter
     - Default
     - Description
   * - ``job_checkup``
     - ``false``
     - Check the status of all QM jobs and generate summary reports under
       ``checkup/`` in the current working directory.
   * - ``delete_queued``
     - ``false``
     - Delete ``.submit_record`` files for unfinished jobs, allowing them
       to be resubmitted.
   * - ``multiwfn_path``
     - ``'Multiwfn'``
     - Path to the Multiwfn executable. If Multiwfn is on your ``PATH``,
       the default works. Atomic radii come from the bundled
       ``qp.resources`` package (there is no ``atmrad_path`` config key).
   * - ``charge_scheme``
     - ``'Hirshfeld'``
     - Single charge scheme for Multiwfn analysis. Options: ``Hirshfeld``,
       ``Voronoi``, ``Mulliken``, ``ADCH``, ``Hirshfeld-I``, ``CM5``.
       Do not pass a comma-separated list.
   * - ``calc_charge_schemes``
     - ``false``
     - Run Multiwfn to compute partial atomic charges.
   * - ``calc_dipole``
